    "By \"binary package\", we mean a package that has already been built (or compiled) for a particular system.  This has a very definite advantage for us:  Because the package has already been built, we can install it without having to worry about whether we have the prerequisite tools or libraries installed on our computer — it should \"just work\".\n",
