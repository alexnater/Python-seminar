    "The way that assertion statements work is very simple; if an assertion turns out to be false (i.e. if Python executes our function on the input “ATGC” and the answer isn’t `0.5`) then the program will fail with an `AssertionError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions are useful in a number of ways. They provide a means for us to check whether our functions are working as intended and therefore help us track down errors in our programs. If we get some unexpected output from a program that uses a particular function, and the assertion tests for that function all pass, then we can be reasonably confident that the error doesn’t lie in the function but in the code that calls it.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also let us modify a function and check that we haven’t introduced any errors. If we have a function that passes a series of assertion tests, and we make some changes to it, we can re-run the assertion tests and, assuming they all pass, be reasonably confident that we haven’t broken the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assertions are also useful as a form of documentation. By including a collection of assertion tests alongside a function, we can show exactly what output is expected from a given input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use assertions to test the behaviour of our function for unusual inputs. For example, what is the expected behaviour of `get_gc_content()` when given a DNA sequence that includes unknown bases (usually represented as N)? A sensible way to handle unknown bases would be to exclude them from the GC content calculation – in other words, the GC content for a given sequence shouldn’t be affected by adding a bunch of unknown bases. We can write an assertion that expresses this:"
