And it also turns out that a programming language — just like a natural language — shapes the thinking of those using it:  One can only conceive of that which you can express.  So I've come to terms with the fact that this *is* a Python course in one sense.\n",

    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Despite being easy to pick up, Python has **no artificial ceiling**. It can scale from small scripts comprising just a few lines, to large applications comprising hundreds of thousands of lines of code.  (This is why it's used by NASA and Google, among others.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is simple to pick up partially because it has a **small core** and intentionally **clear syntax**. This means that students get productive more quickly and find it easier to keep the \"working set\" of required knowledge in their heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is a fairly **consistent** language. Once you learn a rule, you need not generally waste time learning a hundred exceptions to that rule.\n",

    "\n",

    "* Python is a good **general-purpose** programming language &mdash; it's not focused on one application field to the detriment of potential use in other areas. Its creators focus on creating a good language, rather than a tool for solving problems in a particular field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a combined result of the previous two points, Python excels in a variety of areas a scientist programmer might be interested in.  With Python, you can do your batch scripting, file manipulations, text processing, statistical analysis, and data visualisation.  You don't *need* to learn multiple languages, or cobble projects together using them;  Python allows you to **do everything in one language**.\n",

    "\n",

    "* Python is a **practical language for use in bioinformatics**.  It deals easily and naturally with the types of data and problems we face in bioinformatics. Mature libraries are available for all manner of bioinformatics tasks, meaning you won't have to write everything from scratch. If you work your way through this course, you ought to walk out with a tool that you can immediately apply in your day-to-day work.\n",

    "* Python is **free**. The copyright has been assigned to a non-profit organisation, and all major implementations are open source. You can use it at no cost, and with full confidence that you’ll always be able to do so in future."

In an installed Python environment, the core langauge is implemented by a single binary program we call the Python *interpreter*.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Around the core language is the **standard library**.  This is a large array of more specialised Python *modules* that ship with the Python interpreter and is therefore available wherever Python is installed.  The standard library is maintained to a high standard by the same core team of Python develers who maintain the Python language specification and reference implementation.\n",
    "\n",

Because they're maintained by a loose-knit community of individual contributors, there's little or no real organisation here.  Hence there's planty of overlap, some large gaps, and obvious differences in quality between individual libraries.  Navigating this sea of existing Python code is certainly part of workaday life for the Python programmer.  On the upside, it means he or she seldom has to code something from scratch:  There are almost always shoulders to stand on."

    "Finally — to really throw a spanner in the works — we're using a variety of operating systems, e.g. Linux systems, Windows computers and Macs.  Some of us face multiple such environments in our daily work.  Fortunately, Anaconda is a cross-platform toolset.\n",
